Please provide correct and very concise answers to the following questions from
a graduate-level exam from Advanced Virology 3: DNA Viruses.
Use technical or advanced language as appropriate to the level of the course
to answer the question correctly.



Some questions may have multiple parts, denoted by letters after the question number.
For example: 1A and 1B. When answering multiple part questions, refer to the answer of
previous parts of the question as necessary to answer each question correctly.

Do not include numeric lists in the answer unless the question specifically asks for one.

If the question asks for a sketch, provide detailed instructions to draw the requested sketch.

Answers will be provided back to the examiner by copying and pasting answers into a
document.

For formatting of any responses, provide each answer as
plain text without markup symbols or header markers such as "**" or "--".

Q2) We read the paper Bruner et al. in which they characterize the latency reservoir of HIV in cART treated individuals.

They found that only a small fraction (about 2%) actually harbor replication competent proviruses. below is Figure 1 c and d depicting the genome structure of the proviruses they analyzed by sequencing and a pie chart showing the mutations they found.

Please explain for **any four** of the eight color-coded categories in the piechart d below the mechanism(s) of how these mutations occurred, and how they would affect viral replication. (12 points)

Four of the categories depicted in the pie chart (Figure 1d) and their associated mechanisms along with the effects on viral replication are as follows:

1. **Intact (Brown, 2%)**:
   Mechanism: These proviruses are fully intact, meaning they have no mutations that disrupt their functional ability. These sequences maintain the correct reading frames and regulatory elements required for the expression of viral genes and replication.
   Effect on Viral Replication: Because these proviruses are intact and replication-competent, they can produce infectious virions if reactivated. This makes them a significant part of the latent reservoir that poses a challenge for eradication efforts.

2. **Deletion within 5' half of the genome (Dark Blue, 35%)**:
   Mechanism: These deletions usually occur during reverse transcription, where the reverse transcriptase enzyme can slip or pause, causing incomplete synthesis or excision of template regions. This process could be more frequent due to the lack of a proofreading function in reverse transcriptase.
   Effect on Viral Replication: Deletions in the 5' region often disrupt essential genes like *gag* or *pol*, which encode core structural proteins and enzymes, respectively. This makes these proviruses defective and unable to replicate or produce infectious virus particles.

3. **Hypermutated (Light Green, 8%)**:
   Mechanism: Hypermutation mainly occurs due to the activity of host APOBEC3G/F proteins, which can induce extensive G-to-A hypermutations in the viral genome during reverse transcription. APOBEC proteins introduce deamination of cytosine to uracil, resulting in G-to-A mutations when the uracil is copied as adenine in the minus strand.
   Effect on Viral Replication: Hypermutation generally leads to the creation of stop codons and nonfunctional proteins, rendering the provirus replication-incompetent. This is because essential viral proteins are truncated or otherwise inactivated by these mutations.

4. **Packaging signal and major splice donor site deletion (Green, 7%)**:
   Mechanism: Specific deletions in these critical regions generally occur due to errors during reverse transcription or recombination events within the viral RNA. The packaging signal (Î¨) is essential for the incorporation of the viral RNA into new virions, and the major splice donor site is crucial for proper viral RNA splicing.
   Effect on Viral Replication: Deletion of the packaging signal prevents the viral RNA from being recognized and incorporated into new virions, while deletion of the major splice donor site disrupts the processing of viral mRNA, leading to insufficient production of essential viral proteins. Both of these deletions result in replication-defective virus.
