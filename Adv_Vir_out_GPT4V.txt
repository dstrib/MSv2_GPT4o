Please provide correct and very concise answers to the following questions from
a graduate-level exam from Advanced Virology 3: DNA Viruses.
Use technical or advanced language as appropriate to the level of the course
to answer the question correctly.



Some questions may have multiple parts, denoted by letters after the question number.
For example: 1A and 1B. When answering multiple part questions, refer to the answer of
previous parts of the question as necessary to answer each question correctly.

Do not include numeric lists in the answer unless the question specifically asks for one.

If the question asks for a sketch, provide detailed instructions to draw the requested sketch.

Answers will be provided back to the examiner by copying and pasting answers into a
document.

For formatting of any responses, provide each answer as
plain text without markup symbols or header markers such as "**" or "--".

I am ready to provide you with questions to answer.

Q2) We read the paper Bruner et al. in which they characterize the latency reservoir of HIV in cART treated individuals.

They found that only a small fraction (about 2%) actually harbor replication competent proviruses. below is Figure 1 c and d depicting the genome structure of the proviruses they analyzed by sequencing and a pie chart showing the mutations they found.

Please explain for **any four** of the eight color-coded categories in the piechart d below the mechanism(s) of how these mutations occurred, and how they would affect viral replication. (12 points)

Based on pie chart d from the figure provided in your question, I will explain the mechanisms by which four of the eight color-coded categories of mutations could occur, as well as their potential impact on viral replication:

1. **Hypermutated (20%)**:
    - **Mechanism**: Hypermutation is often due to the activity of APOBEC3G, a host cytidine deaminase that induces G-to-A mutations in the viral genome during reverse transcription. Hypermutation can result in extensive G-to-A transitions throughout the HIV genome.
    - **Impact on Replication**: This type of mutation can lead to premature stop codons and dysfunctional proteins, which severely impairs the ability of the virus to replicate and propagate.

2. **Deletion within 3' half of the genome (35%)**:
    - **Mechanism**: Deletions can occur as a result of errors during viral reverse transcription, recombination events, or defective genomic integration. Deletions in the 3' half often impact essential genes like env, which are crucial for viral entry into host cells.
    - **Impact on Replication**: Deletions in this region can abolish or drastically reduce the virus's ability to enter target cells, thus blocking subsequent steps of the viral life cycle and reducing overall infectivity.

3. **Very large internal deletion (7%)**:
    - **Mechanism**: Similar to other deletions, very large internal deletions may result from errors in reverse transcription or faulty recombination. These are typically larger and span more critical regions of the genome.
    - **Impact on Replication**: Such deletions likely disrupt multiple viral genes, preventing the synthesis of key proteins needed for various stages of the viral lifecycle, which might include replication, assembly, and release of virions.

4. **Hypermuted and deleted (2%)**:
    - **Mechanism**: This category represents a combination of hypermutation and deletional events, indicating action by both cellular defense mechanisms like APOBEC3G and errors in viral replication or integration.
    - **Impact on Replication**: The dual burden of hypermutation and deletions would not only impair protein function but also result in large genomic gaps. This double-hit can effectively cripple the virus, preventing successful replication and propagation.

Each of these mutational categories highlights different aspects of host-pathogen interaction and the inherent challenges that HIV faces, owing to both its error-prone reverse transcriptase and host cellular defenses.
